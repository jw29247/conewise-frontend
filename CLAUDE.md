---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ WEEK-BY-WEEK BUILD PLAN (2 DEVELOPERS)

## üëá CRITICAL PRINCIPLES DURING BUILD

- ‚úÖ **Strict API contracts** ‚Äî front-end dev consumes backend API as a service, no shortcuts
- ‚úÖ **Clear role split** ‚Äî one owns front, one owns back, but collaborate tightly on API interfaces
- ‚úÖ **Weekly integration checkpoints** ‚Äî devs sync once weekly to verify compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Minimal scope creep** ‚Äî stick to MVP goals. Fancy features come later.
- ‚úÖ Deployment always happens to Railway environments with CI/CD configured from GitHub.

---

## Railway Project Setup

**Project Name**: Conewise

**Services**:
- **Service 1: Backend**
  - FastAPI Docker container
  - Connects to Postgres and Redis internally
- **Service 2: Frontend**
  - React + Vite static deployment
- **Service 3: PostgreSQL** (Railway Managed DB)
- **Service 4: Redis** (Railway Managed Cache)

---

## üå± Environment Naming and Branching Model

### GitHub Branches:
| **Branch** | **Purpose** | **Environment** |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| main | Stable production-ready code | production |
| develop | Active development integration | staging |
| Feature branches | Per feature/task | Local only |

### Railway Environments:
| **Railway Env** | **Source** | **Usage** |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| production | Auto-deploy from main | Live production system |
| staging | Auto-deploy from develop | Developer integration environment |
| preview | Auto-deploy on PR creation | Per-PR preview builds |

**Simple Rule**:
- Only clean, tested code merges into main
- Daily active work happens on develop via feature branches

---

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Railway has built-in GitHub integration:

### Backend (ConeWiseBackend)
1. Connect GitHub repo to Railway backend project
2. Configure:
   - main branch ‚Üí auto-deploy to production env
   - develop branch ‚Üí auto-deploy to staging env

### Frontend (ConeWiseFrontend)
Same setup as backend:
- Connect GitHub repo to Railway frontend project
- main ‚Üí production deployment
- develop ‚Üí staging deployment

---

## üîë Secrets and Environment Variables

### Backend ENV variables:
| **Key** | **Description** |
|---------|-----------------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | GPT-4o API key |
| DATABASE_URL | Railway Postgres URL |
| REDIS_URL | Railway Redis URL |
| JWT_SECRET | JWT signing key |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | Stripe secret key |
| FRONTEND_URL | Frontend URL (for CORS config) |

### Frontend ENV variables:
| **Key** | **Description** |
|---------|-----------------|
| VITE_API_URL | Backend API base URL |

**Critical rule**: Never commit secrets into GitHub repos. Secrets injected via Railway environment settings UI.

---

## üîÑ Development vs Production Data

- Two fully isolated Railway environments:
  - **Production** = real customers, live billing, live plans
  - **Staging** = internal test accounts, dummy Stripe sandbox keys
- Staging DB and Redis are totally separate instances
- Developers can safely test in staging without affecting production

---

## üîí GitHub Protections

### main branch:
- Required pull request approvals (2 approvers ideal)
- Status checks (build passes)
- No direct commits allowed

### develop branch:
- PR required but can be single approval
- Can be merged frequently for rapid testing

### Feature branches:
- Free work area for developers

---

## Development Notes

### Current Frontend Stack:
- React 18.3
- TypeScript 5.6
- Vite 7.0
- React Router 7.2
- Axios 1.7
- React Hook Form 7.54
- Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Zustand 5.0 (state management)
- JWT Decode 4.0

### API Integration Pattern:
- All API calls go through `src/services/api.ts`
- Auth token automatically attached to requests
- 401 responses trigger logout and redirect
- Form errors displayed inline with user-friendly messages

### Next Steps for Week 2:
1. Install MapLibre GL JS
2. Integrate OS NGD API for UK maps
3. Build polygon drawing tools
4. Create plan generation form
5. Connect to backend /generate-plan endpoint
